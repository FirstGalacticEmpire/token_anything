### Repository structure

The repository is divided into two main folders:
* frontend - where you can find source code of our React App
  * We have chosen React because of it's flexbility and vast blockchain and web3 support.
* backend - where source code of backend divided into microservices can be found
  * We have chosen Django, because it supports high complexity of services, and as team we are most acquainted with Python.
